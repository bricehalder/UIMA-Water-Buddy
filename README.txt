1) The slider input mechanism isn't that much of a practical concern due to the slider that I used forcing discrete input and only having 16 different options. Obviously this is less customizable than a text field but will a user ever need to input more than 16 oz or a non-integer amount? Maybe. Also if they have fat thumbs like me, it might be a problem. I can't see a limited undo mechanism becoming a problem with my usage of the app, but I can imagine a scenario where it would be an issue--like if you don't realize your mistake until much later. Even then, the stakes are low, so it doesn't really matter.

2) Resetting the slider back to zero after each input might prevent user error from double-clicking the add button or something, but it could also annoy the user if they have to input 64 oz and they'd have to scroll over to 16 oz 4 times. Obviously these are edge cases, but they're important to consider. Another argument for not resetting the slider to 0 each press of the add button would be that keeping it there respects the user's choices by adding a permanence to their actions and not changing values without their understanding/consent.

3) So I customized the design by laying it out in a more vertical way (to increase readability on more portrait-oriented devices) and removing the water droplets above the slider. The water droplets felt redundant to me considering that text would display the resting position of the slider in real time and any user who uses this app would already need to understand how to read water measurements in oz. I also did my best to make the titular Water Buddy adorable and chose good colors in the same blue family to make the app more visibly pleasing.
